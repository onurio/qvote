      <h2>2. Service Use</h2>
      <p>
        QV provides a Slack integration that allows workspace members to create and participate in quadratic votes. 
        While the code is open source, the hosted service ("Service") is provided as a convenience.
        You may use the Service in compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws and regulations.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
      <p>
        To use the QV Service, you must have a valid Slack account and be a member of a Slack workspace that has installed QV. 
        You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Slack credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. Privacy and Data Deletion</h2>
      <p>
        Your privacy is important to me. My <a href="/static/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> explains how I collect, use, and protect your personal information. 
        By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with my Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        To delete your data from our systems, you must uninstall the QV app from your Slack workspace. Uninstallation of the app 
        automatically triggers deletion of all data associated with your workspace. This is the primary method for data deletion, 
        and we retain your data until you uninstall the app.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>5. Content</h2>
      <p>
        You are solely responsible for any content you create, submit, or display through the Service, including vote questions, options, and responses. 
        You must not use the Service to create or share content that is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        In accordance with the MIT License, the Service is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, 
        including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement.
      </p>
      <p>
        In no event shall I or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, 
        tort or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the Service or the use or other dealings in the Service.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>7. Service Availability</h2>
      <p>
        I reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service (or any part or content thereof) at any time with or without notice. 
        I will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the software is open source, you always have the option to deploy and host your own instance if the provided Service is discontinued.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p>
        I reserve the right to update these Terms at any time. If I make material changes to these Terms, I will notify you by updating the date at the top of these Terms.
        Your continued use of the Service after such modifications will constitute your acknowledgment of the modified Terms.
